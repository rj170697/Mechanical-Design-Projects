# Mechanical-Design-Projects

In this repository I have uploaded different design projects that I have worked on during my internships and academics. It includes designs of piston and articula rod that I have made as an academics assignment during my bachelors. It also includes 3 types of mirror holder that I have designed during my Internship at Jena, Germany. Though its just a .png files I hope it gives a strong hint about my work.
